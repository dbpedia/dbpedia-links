The source of the data is a mix of:

1. extracting the ISIL entry of the infobox from the wikipedia entry. You can "download that extraction":http://ws.gbv.de/wpextract/dewiki-isil.beacon.
2. simple title matching

The first approach does not give (yet) much links (around 150) but is very reliable, while the second approach generates ten times more links of which some may be incorrect.
